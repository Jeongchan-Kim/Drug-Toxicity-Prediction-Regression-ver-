# Drug Toxicity Prediction (Regression)

This model is Regression Version, mainly similar flow of Classifier Version.

The model consists of two main components: a feature extractor and a classifier. The feature extractor is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that takes as input a vector of drug features and outputs a vector of learned features. The classifier takes the output of the feature extractor and applies a series of linear transformations to generate a single output representing the predicted toxicity of the drug.
